This comparative analysis showcase where the situation is down and what all the measures the government should take for overcoming this scenario. This also describes the situation of the region where it has properly handled and other regionâ€™s governing body could implement such measures in their area. 
We are able to determine the recovery rate or death rate of the states where the difference is normal or high as compared to the overall rate of the country.
